My interest in this field was sparked during my PhD, where I focused on the ontogeny of diving and foraging behavior in penguins and seals. </p><p>By utilizing <a href="https://wildlifecomputers.com/our-tags/splash-archiving-tags/splash10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARGOS relayed Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs) and accelerometers</a> to closely monitor the behaviors of young <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">king penguins</a>, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v609/p1-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emperor penguins</a>, and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.4717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">southern elephant seals</a>. These devices enabled us to track the juveniles’ extensive dispersion across the Southern Ocean, their adaptation to local currents and frontal zones, and their spatial segregation from adults. Notably, these juveniles displayed rapid development in diving capabilities, yet they didn't fully match adult efficiency even after a year.</p><p>This research revealed the complex nature of the ontogeny of foraging behavior, highlighting the interplay between innate behavior, individual traits, and environmental factors. The insights from this study have enhanced our comprehension of marine predator behavior and drawn attention to the crucial first year at sea, a period noted for notable mortality in the three species examined.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1hjcvaj1t8v">Movement Ecology</h1><p>Movement ecology is a field focused on understanding how organisms move through space and time, specifically looking at the patterns, mechanisms, and consequences of their movements. This discipline is particularly critical in studying animals' habitat selection processes, migration paths, and overall spatial behavior. Tracking devices like <a href="https://www.argos-system.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARGOS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_animal_tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPS</a>, which rely on satellite technology, are instrumental in this field, providing fine-scale location data. These devices allow us to gather detailed, continuous data on individual movements, significantly enhancing our understanding of animal behavior in their natural habitats.</p><p>Such tools have revolutionized our understanding of juvenile movement and habitat selection. My interest in this field was particularly piqued by research on juvenile king penguins, as outlined in the article "<a href="https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-019-0175-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploration during early life: distribution, habitat, and orientation preferences in juvenile king penguins.</a>" In this study we tracked juvenile penguins using satellite relay tags, revealing their innate and learned skills in navigating to foraging areas. The research underscored the criticality of the first year at sea for long-lived species and provided unprecedented insights into their distribution, habitat preferences, and orientation. Read a nice summary of this article made by a student for the general public <a href="https://papiermachesciences.org/2021/10/19/naviguer-quand-on-na-jamais-navigue-mieux-comprendre-le-comportement-en-mer-des-manchots-royaux-grace-aux-donnees-satellites/?v=C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (in French).</p><p>Similarly, in the study "<a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.13552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatial segregation in a sexually dimorphic central place forager: Competitive exclusion or niche divergence?</a>" involving wandering albatrosses, we used GPS loggers to investigate spatial segregation based on sex. This research delved into the relative importance of intra- and inter-population competition in influencing sex-specific distribution and habitat preferences. The study's results suggested that historical intra-population competition might have led to sexual dimorphism and niche specialization, thus favoring the 'niche divergence' hypothesis.</p><p>These studies primarily challenge our understanding of the development of distribution and segregation patterns based on age and sex. Grasping the timing and process of their emergence offers deep insights into the evolutionary dynamics involved, suggesting a combination of spatial memory and inherited migration programs as driving factors. Such findings underscore the significance of investigating behavioral development to better understand complex eco-evolutionary processes.</p><h1 id="mcetoc_1hjcvaj1t90">Dispersal Ecology</h1><p>Dispersal ecology is a crucial aspect of understanding population dynamics and species distribution. It focuses on the movement of organisms from their birthplace or current location to new breeding habitats. New tracking technologies have the potential to revolutionize this field, allowing for detailed and continuous tracking of individuals over extended periods. Such advancements are vital for longitudinal studies, enabling the observation of the settlement process during natal dispersal with unprecedented precision.</p><p>The article "<a href="https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.06729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shift in habitat selection during natal dispersal in a long-lived raptor species</a>" exemplifies the potential of such technologies. By deploying <a href="https://ecotone-telemetry.com/index.php/en/products/gps-gsm-139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solar-powered GPS-GSM transmitters</a> on nestlings, we could continuously track red kites for up to six years, from fledging to settlement. This long-term tracking allowed for the application of habitat selection functions, revealing how habitat preferences change from the prospecting phase of natal dispersal to the more selective settlement phase. </p><p>This shift is crucial for conservation efforts, as it reveals the varying environmental constraints and habitat needs at different life stages. Moreover, this indicates that long-term data on habitat selection and natal dispersal can shed light on how populations may expand or relocate in response to environmental changes and anthropogenic pressures.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yj-6paQAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Scholar</a> | <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florian-Orgeret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research Gate</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/FlOrgeret">Twitter (X)</a> | <a href="https://github.com/florianorgeret">GitHub</a></p><p>© Florian Orgeret 2024 | Powered by Publii using the Simple theme.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://florianorgeret.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://florianorgeret.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
